# 🔧 Fix for "process-audio1" Error

## The Problem

Your browser is using **old cached JavaScript** that has the wrong URL (`/api/process-audio1` instead of `/api/process-audio`).

## Solution: Clear Cache and Rebuild

### Step 1: Stop the Frontend Server

In the terminal running `npm run dev`, press **Ctrl+C**

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache

**Option A: Hard Refresh (Quick)**
1. Open your browser
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or **Ctrl+F5**)
3. This forces a fresh reload

**Option B: Clear Cache Completely**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 3: Rebuild and Restart Frontend

```bash
cd "c:\Users\USER\Downloads\BRD4-main (1)\BRD4-main"
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Again

1. Go to `http://localhost:5025` (or `http://localhost:5173`)
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Upload an audio file
4. Check the Network tab - it should now call `/api/process-audio` (without the "1")

## Quick Fix Commands

Run these in order:

```bash
# Stop frontend (Ctrl+C in the npm terminal)

# Clear npm cache (optional but recommended)
cd "c:\Users\USER\Downloads\BRD4-main (1)\BRD4-main"
npm cache clean --force

# Restart frontend
npm run dev
```

Then in your browser:
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+Delete**
- Clear "Cached images and files"
- Close and reopen the browser
- Go to `http://localhost:5025`

---

## Why This Happened

The browser cached the old version of your JavaScript files. When you made changes to the code, the browser kept using the old version instead of loading the new one.

---

## Verify It's Fixed

After clearing cache, check the browser console. The error should now show:
```
Failed to load resource: http://localhost:5000/api/process-audio
```
(Without the "1" at the end)

If the Python backend is running, the request should succeed!
