# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Audio Transcription

## ✅ What I Did For You

I've created an **automated script** that starts both servers you need!

---

## 🎯 How to Use (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Start Both Servers

**Find and double-click this file:**
```
START-BOTH-SERVERS.bat
```

**Location:** `c:\Users\USER\Downloads\BRD4-main (1)\BRD4-main\START-BOTH-SERVERS.bat`

This will open **TWO terminal windows**:
- 🐍 **Window 1**: Python Backend (Port 5000)
- 🌐 **Window 2**: Frontend (Port 5173 or 5025)

### Step 2: Wait for Both to Start

**Window 1** should show:
```
============================================
Audio Transcription & Summarization Backend
============================================
Server starting on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

**Window 2** should show:
```
serving on port 5025
```

### Step 3: Open Your Browser

Go to: **http://localhost:5173** (or **http://localhost:5025**)
